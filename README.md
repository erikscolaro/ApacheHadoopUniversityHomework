# ApacheHadoopUniversityHomework

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of Apache Hadoop MapReduce exercises and exams that are part of the BigData course curriculum for the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. These programs demonstrate data processing and analysis using the Hadoop ecosystem with a focus on the MapReduce programming model.

## Contents

The repository is organized into multiple components:

- **Lab1**: Basic MapReduce implementation for word count and word pair analysis
- **Lab2**: Implementation of grouping operations and data aggregation in Hadoop
- **Lab3**: Advanced MapReduce patterns including TopK algorithms and co-occurrence analysis
- **Lab4**: Processing user reviews data with multi-stage MapReduce jobs
- **Exam_2022_07_04**: Analysis of OS patches over a specific date range
- **Exam_2024_02_02**: Analysis of game applications focusing on free vs. paid apps
- **Exam_2025_02_04**: Processing country and subscription plan data for user segmentation
- **Exam_2025_09_12**: Analysis of product categories to identify performance trends

## Skills & Technologies

- **Apache Hadoop**: Core MapReduce framework for distributed processing
- **HDFS**: Hadoop Distributed File System for data storage
- **Java**: Implementation language for MapReduce jobs
- **Data Transformation**: Map, reduce, combine operations for data manipulation
- **Distributed Computing**: Principles of parallel data processing
- **Data Analytics**: Extracting insights from large datasets

## Execution Environment

All exercises were implemented as Java applications using the Hadoop MapReduce framework. The code can be executed on both local Hadoop instances and distributed clusters. The implementations demonstrate efficient use of mappers, reducers, and combiners in the Hadoop MapReduce model.
