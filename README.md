# ApacheHadoopUniversityHomework

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of Apache Hadoop MapReduce exercises part of the BigData course curriculum for the first year of the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering (AI Track) at Politecnico di Torino. These labs demonstrate the implementation of distributed computing solutions using the Hadoop ecosystem.

## Contents

The repository is organized into multiple lab modules:

- **Lab1**: Basic MapReduce application implementing a word count algorithm with paired words
- **Lab2**: Advanced MapReduce patterns focusing on data grouping and aggregation
- **Lab3**: Multi-job MapReduce workflow with chained jobs for complex data processing
- **Lab4**: Advanced analytics implementing a recommendation system using MapReduce

## Skills & Technologies

- **Apache Hadoop**: Core MapReduce framework for distributed computing
- **HDFS**: Hadoop Distributed File System for data storage
- **Java**: Implementation of MapReduce jobs
- **Big Data Processing**: Design patterns for distributed data analysis
- **Data Analytics**: Algorithms for extracting insights from large datasets

## Execution Environment

All exercises were executed on a Hadoop cluster provided by Politecnico di Torino, utilizing HDFS for distributed storage. The implementations follow standard MapReduce design patterns and best practices for distributed computing.
